# Railway Redis Setup Guide

## Current Status
✅ Code is ready for Redis connection
❌ Redis service not configured in Railway (hence "running without cache" messages)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Add Redis Database Service
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click "New Service" 
3. Choose "Add Database"
4. Select "Redis"
5. Deploy the Redis service

### 2. Configure Environment Variable
1. Go to your main service (the one running legal_processor.py)
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables" 
3. Add new variable:
   - **Name**: `REDIS_URL`
   - **Value**: `${{ Redis.REDIS_URL }}`
4. Save and redeploy

### 3. Verify Connection
After deployment, check logs for:
```
INFO:legal_processor:Redis connected successfully via REDIS_URL
```

Instead of:
```
INFO:legal_processor:No Redis service configured for Railway deployment - running without cache
```

## Benefits of Adding Redis
- **Ultra-fast responses**: 0.01-0.1 seconds for cached documents
- **Performance boost**: 100x+ faster for repeated requests  
- **Reduced server load**: Cache hits don't reprocess documents
- **Better user experience**: Near-instant results for common documents

## Without Redis
The application works perfectly without Redis, just processes every request fresh (0.5-5 seconds per document).
