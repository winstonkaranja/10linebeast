# Railway Redis Setup Guide

## Current Status
✅ Code is ready for Redis connection and supports Railway's auto-provided variables
❌ Redis service not added to Railway project yet

## Simple Setup Steps

### 1. Add Redis Database Service (Only Step Needed!)
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click "New Service" 
3. Choose "Add Database"
4. Select "Redis"
5. Deploy the Redis service

**That's it!** Railway automatically provides these environment variables:
- `REDISHOST` - Redis server hostname
- `REDISPORT` - Redis server port
- `REDISUSER` - Redis username (if applicable)
- `REDISPASSWORD` - Redis password

### 2. Verify Connection
After adding Redis service, check logs for:
```
INFO:legal_processor:Redis connected successfully via Railway Redis variables
```

Instead of:
```
INFO:legal_processor:No Redis service configured for Railway deployment - running without cache
```

## Benefits of Adding Redis
- **Ultra-fast responses**: 0.01-0.1 seconds for cached documents
- **Performance boost**: 100x+ faster for repeated requests  
- **Reduced server load**: Cache hits don't reprocess documents
- **Better user experience**: Near-instant results for common documents

## Without Redis
The application works perfectly without Redis, just processes every request fresh (0.5-5 seconds per document).
