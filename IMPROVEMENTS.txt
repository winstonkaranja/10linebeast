MAJOR FIX: 10TH LINE NUMBERING FOR COMPLEX PDFs
===============================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
------------------
The original 10th line numbering implementation had critical issues with complex PDFs:
- Counted ALL text blocks including watermarks, headers, footers
- Table cells and image text interfered with accurate line counting
- OCR'd text from images was incorrectly included in line counts
- Multi-column layouts caused confusion in line ordering
- Decorative elements like logos and stamps were treated as content
- No distinction between main document content and layout elements

SYMPTOMS:
---------
- Line numbers appearing on wrong lines
- Inconsistent numbering in documents with tables
- Watermarks being counted as content lines
- Headers and footers disrupting the count sequence
- Inaccurate line intervals (not every 10th actual content line)

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
====================

1. SMART CONTENT FILTERING SYSTEM
---------------------------------
- New function: _extract_main_content_lines()
- Filters content BEFORE counting lines
- Focuses only on substantial document content
- Excludes decorative and layout elements

2. WATERMARK DETECTION & FILTERING
----------------------------------
- New function: _is_likely_watermark()
- Detects common watermark keywords:
  * "CONFIDENTIAL", "DRAFT", "SAMPLE", "COPY"
  * "PREVIEW", "TRIAL", "DEMO", "COPYRIGHT"
  * "WATERMARK", "TRADEMARK", "©"
- Identifies centered short text (typical watermark placement)
- Filters single-word repeated elements
- Detects text within 50 points of page center

3. HEADER/FOOTER DETECTION & FILTERING
--------------------------------------
- New function: _is_likely_header_footer()
- Recognizes page numbers (standalone digits)
- Filters legal document headers:
  * "CONFIDENTIAL", "ATTORNEY-CLIENT", "PRIVILEGED"
  * "COPYRIGHT", "ALL RIGHTS RESERVED"
- Detects date patterns with regex:
  * MM/DD/YYYY, MM-DD-YYYY formats
  * "Month DD, YYYY" format
- Excludes content in top/bottom 10% of page

4. TABLE ELEMENT DETECTION & FILTERING
--------------------------------------
- New function: _is_likely_table_element()
- Identifies column headers:
  * "Name", "Date", "Amount", "Total", "Item"
  * "Description", "Quantity", "Price", "Cost"
  * "Number", "ID", "Type", "Status"
- Filters short table cell content (< 3 characters)
- Detects numeric/symbol-heavy content (table data)
- Excludes single-word table elements

5. SPATIAL FILTERING
-------------------
- Excludes header/footer areas (top/bottom 10% of page)
- Skips side margins (left/right 5% of page)
- Filters very small text blocks (< 10pt height, < 50pt width)
- Ignores image blocks containing OCR'd text

6. IMPROVED LINE PROCESSING
---------------------------
- Sorts lines by vertical position (top-to-bottom)
- Maintains proper line sequence across complex layouts
- Extracts text from spans correctly
- Skips empty lines and whitespace-only content

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
=================

Files Modified:
--------------
- legal_processor.py (lines 378-599)
  * Enhanced _apply_tenth_lining_fast() function
  * Added 4 new filtering functions
  * Improved content extraction logic

New Functions Added:
-------------------
1. _extract_main_content_lines(text_dict, page_rect) -> list
   - Main content filtering orchestrator
   - Returns filtered list of content lines with positions

2. _is_likely_watermark(text, line_bbox, page_rect) -> bool
   - Watermark detection based on keywords and positioning

3. _is_likely_header_footer(text) -> bool  
   - Header/footer detection using patterns and regex

4. _is_likely_table_element(text, line_bbox) -> bool
   - Table element detection for headers and data

Test Files Created:
------------------
- simple_test.py: Comprehensive filtering logic tests
- test_tenth_lining.py: Full PDF processing tests

RESULTS & BENEFITS:
==================

TECHNICAL NOTES:
===============
- Uses PyMuPDF (fitz) for advanced text extraction
- Leverages bounding box coordinates for spatial filtering
- Implements regex patterns for date/number detection
- Maintains thread-safe operations for parallel processing
- Preserves existing codebase architecture and patterns

This improvement resolves the core issue with 10th line numbering on complex PDFs
and ensures accurate, professional line numbering for legal document processing.

ADDITIONAL FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS (LATEST SESSION):
=================================================

COORDINATE SYSTEM FIX:
---------------------
PROBLEM: 10th line numbering was appearing from bottom to top instead of top to bottom

ROOT CAUSE: Incorrect understanding of PyMuPDF coordinate system
- PyMuPDF uses TOP-LEFT origin (Y=0 at top, increases downward)
- Standard PDF uses BOTTOM-LEFT origin (Y=0 at bottom, increases upward)
- Was using reverse=True sort which gave bottom-to-top numbering

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
- Changed from: lines.sort(key=lambda x: x['y'], reverse=True)
- To: lines.sort(key=lambda x: x['y'])  # Ascending order for top-to-bottom
- Added coordinate system analysis tools for debugging
- File: legal_processor.py, line 512

RESULTS:
✅ Line numbering now correctly appears from top of document downward
✅ 10th, 20th, 30th lines numbered in proper sequence

PAGE NUMBERING IMPROVEMENTS:
---------------------------
CHANGES MADE:
1. POSITION: Moved page numbers from top-right to bottom-center of page
   - Old: letter[0] - 50, letter[1] - 30 (top-right corner)
   - New: page_width/2 - 10, 30 (bottom-center, 30pt from bottom)

2. FONT SIZE: Increased page numbering font by 20%
   - Old: 15pt font
   - New: 18pt font (15 * 1.2 = 18)

3. POSITIONING: Better centering algorithm
   - Calculates page center: page_width / 2
   - Slight adjustment (-10pt) for text width centering
   - Consistent 30pt margin from bottom edge

10TH LINE NUMBERING FONT IMPROVEMENT:
------------------------------------
CHANGE MADE:
- Increased 10th line numbering font size by 30%
- Old: 9.6pt font
- New: 12.5pt font (9.6 * 1.3 = 12.48 ≈ 12.5)
- Maintains right-alignment at page margin
- Keeps gray color (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) for subtle appearance

TECHNICAL DETAILS OF LATEST FIXES:
==================================

Files Modified:
--------------
1. legal_processor.py (lines 360-365): Page numbering position and font
2. legal_processor.py (line 417): 10th line numbering font size
3. legal_processor.py (line 512): Coordinate system sorting fix

Code Changes:
------------
1. Page Numbering (function: add_page_numbers_fast):
   OLD:
   ```python
   can.setFont("Helvetica", 15)
   can.drawString(letter[0] - 50, letter[1] - 30, str(page_num))
   ```
   
   NEW:
   ```python
   can.setFont("Helvetica", 18)  # 20% larger font
   page_width = letter[0]
   x_center = page_width / 2 - 10  # Bottom center position
   y_bottom = 30  # 30 points from bottom
   can.drawString(x_center, y_bottom, str(page_num))
   ```

2. 10th Line Numbering (function: add_tenth_lines_fast):
   OLD:
   ```python
   fontsize=9.6
   ```
   
   NEW:
   ```python
   fontsize=12.5  # 30% larger font (9.6 * 1.3)
   ```

3. Line Sorting (function: _extract_main_content_lines):
   OLD:
   ```python
   lines.sort(key=lambda x: x['y'], reverse=True)  # Wrong: bottom-to-top
   ```
   
   NEW:
   ```python
   lines.sort(key=lambda x: x['y'])  # Correct: top-to-bottom
   ```

VISUAL IMPROVEMENTS SUMMARY:
===========================
